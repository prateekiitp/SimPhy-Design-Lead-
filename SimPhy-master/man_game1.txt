About the game:


This game will take you through the world of kinematics. 
In this game, we will see all the possible cases of 
linear motion, ie, motion in one dimension.  
All the fundamental equations of kinematics are analyzed 
in the given game and the resultant motion is shown 
through simple yet exciting animation.


How to Play:


1.Start SimPhy.

2.Click on the first Game, ie, Linear Motion.
3.The game will ask user to select the parameter whose value 
  is to be calculated. Click on the required button.
4.The game will now ask the user to select the formula that 
  you wish to use for calculating the above parameter.
5.Input the values of the various parameters and then press Enter.
6.The game will now ask the user to select the type of Road. 
   Select the Road.
7.The game will now ask the user to select the type of vehicle. 
   Select the vehicle.
8.The resulting motion of the vehicle can now be seen with the 
   value of the required parameter.
9.Click on Play Again to try out some different values of 
  various parameters.
